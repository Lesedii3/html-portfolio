<h3>Sarafina</h3>
<p>A powerful film set in apartheid-era South Africa,<br> Following a young black girl named Sarafina as she becomes<BR> involved in the Soweto Uprising and fights against oppression.
<br>It reminds me of my countrys history</p>
<h3>Grown-Ups</h3>
<p>This a comedy film about a group of childhood friends,<br> who reunite after many years for a Fourth of July weekend at a lake house.<BR> The movie follows their hilarious antics and heartwarming moments,<br> as they reminisce about the past and navigate the challenges of adulthood.<BR> I love it because it's a feel-good movie </p>
<h3>Pink Panther</h3>
<p>classic comedy film following the clumsy but endearing French detective,<br> Inspector Jacques Clouseau, as he tries to solve the mystery of the stolen Pink Panther diamond. Filled with slapstick humor and clever wit, it's a timeless comedy that keeps audiences entertained with its hilarious antics and memorable characters</p>
