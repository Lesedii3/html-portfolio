<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi there! I'm Lesedi Sekhukhune</p> A first-year student pursuing Information Technology and a budding web developer. âœ¨ I'm currently exploring the exciting world where technology meets creativity, and I couldn't be more thrilled to learn and grow in this field.</p>
<p>ðŸ§  With a deep interest in human behavior, I find myself drawn to the principles of behavioral economics and psychology and how they can be effectively applied in the digital world. Understanding user behavior and crafting intuitive experiences are my strengths as a developer.</p>
  
ðŸŒ±  As an INFJ personality type, I bring a unique perspective to my work, combining technical skills with insight and foresight. I believe that by integrating insights from behavioral economics and psychology, we can design websites and applications that not only meet users' needs but also resonate with them on a deeper level.</p>
  
  When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest research in behavioral economics, diving into psychology books, or experimenting with new design techniques. I'm a firm believer in the power of continuous learning and am always eager to explore new ideas and technologies.ðŸ’» </p>
  
  ðŸŒŸ Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities together!</p>
